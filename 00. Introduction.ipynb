    "One of the unique things about this course is that you work on basic elements to help you with a temperature control project. You will see your Python code have a real effect by adjusting heaters to maintain a target temperature, just like a thermostat in a home or office.\n",

    "One of the best ways to start or review a programming language is to work on a simple project. These exercises are designed to teach basic Python programming skills to help you design a temperature controller. Temperature control is found in many applications such as home or office HVAC, manufacturing processes, transportation, and life sciences. Even our bodies regulate to a specific temperature.\n",

    "This project is to regulate the temperature of the TCLab (Temperature Control Lab). Each TCLab has thermochromic (changes color with temperature) paint that turns from black to purple when the temperature reaches the target temperature of 37°C (99°F).\n",

    "The first thing that you'll need is to install Anaconda and run the Jupyter notebook. [Download Anaconda to use Jupyter](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [watch a video on how to install it](https://youtu.be/LrMOrMb8-3s).\n",

    "The video shows how to install Anaconda and a few things you can do with the Jupyter Notebook. Examples are with Jupyter Notebook and Spyder. There are [additional instructions on installing Python and managing modules](https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/InstallPython)."
