The final test is for 10 minutes but use a shorter time (maybe 10 seconds) as you test your code. Good luck!\n",

    "**Objective**: Program the TCLab to maintain the temperature (`T1`) at 37°C by adjusting the heater (`Q1`). Display the heater level (`Q1`) with an LED indicator as the program is adjusting the temperature. Create a plot of the temperature and heater values over a 10 minute evaluation period.\n",
