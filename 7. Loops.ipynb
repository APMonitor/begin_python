    "These loops work by repeating until their condition becomes _false_. These loops often get you stuck in an infinite loop if you aren't careful. You can stop the infinite loop by setting the value of true to become false in many ways. In the code below, the infinite loop is broken by making x one less each time it goes through the loop, with ```x = x - 1```. Try changing the value of ```x```."

    "Now here's the twist. In a for loop the ```i``` variable, in ```for i in ```\\___```:```, can be used during the repeated loop. Everytime the for loop goes again, it goes to the next value. For numbers, it starts at 0 so if the loop had a ```range(3)```, it would count 0, 1, 2. Strings it just prints the characters in order so ```\"hi\"``` would just be h, i. This can be used in a number of useful ways you may use later in this course."
