    "# Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest time consumers in programming is debugging, or mistakes in your programming. This is true for every language because the computer needs exact commands, which is very important for precise measurements for incubating. To limit this mistake, a couple of steps can limit the time you are just looking for mistakes, instead of just programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for more effective programming\n",
    "#### _First_\n",
    "You should start with understanding the big picture. It seems silly, but once you start going over the whole thing you find a lot of gaps. Do this in whichever way suits you best, we’ll leave it up to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "For incubation, it would be understanding what you actually need to do for keeping an egg in good conditions.\n",
    "#### _Second_\n",
    "Start with outlining your code, writing in English what you want the code to do, then break it into more direct tasks. You can do this once you understand the basics of python, so you know what you are capable of programming and to make sure your programming isn't more complex than it needs to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something like setting the value of temperature to a certain number, instead of a complex equation to get the same number.\n",
    "#### _Third_\n",
    "Program the specific tasks and connect them together. The explained direct tasks make it significantly easier to program. It’s a lot harder to program something all in one go if the program is bigger. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means programming something specific like how hard the heater should work, based on how low a temperature reading is.\n",
    "#### _Fourth_\n",
    "Test and fix problems. Basically debugging, but don’t only test the whole project all in one go. It’s much easier to find a problem if you test every once in a while, when you are programming smaller parts. A good way to do this is grab a specific piece of code, run it on a seperate file, and see if it does the job you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example would be fixing when the heater should stop working, so the egg doesn't go over temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The better you follow these steps the less time you will have to spend fixing problems in your code for your incubators, or just python programs in general.)"
