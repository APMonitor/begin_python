    "The internet is an important resource when it comes to general programming information. Learn to search information from tutorial sites and quickly find the information that you need. Specific websites that can be helpful are StackOverflow, Geeks for Geeks, and many more. Below are some helps for math, comparison, logical, plotting, and turtle methods as examples of the types of resources that you'll find. The hardest part about using the Internet as a resource is how to quickly sort through the information to find the specific answer that you need. Sometimes the hardest part is formulating the correct question.\n",
