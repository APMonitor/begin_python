    "Variables are something that stores information in python. For example, if you wanted to keep a set temperature for an egg, you would type ```egg = 99.5```. The first part tells what the variable will be called, and the value after the ```=``` tells what is being stored. \n",

    "## Values in Variables\n",
    "There are many types of values but for now, weâ€™ll just go through the basics. You can run the code, but in this case the computer won't tell you anything, because you're just storing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "While you can run a program by clicking the run button towards the top of the screen, a better way to run cells individually is to click a cell, then hold ```Ctrl``` and press ```Enter```. Running this way means you're running one cell at a time, instead of all at once. Some Jupyter Notebooks also have the run button to the left of the program cell."

Different types of value typically can't be combined, such as ```5 + \"degC\"```. This can sometimes be fixed if you need __5degC__ to be output. All you do is change the value type of ```5``` manually into a __string__, ```str(5) + \"degC\"```. But, you can't turn a __string__ into a __interger__ which makes sense, the letter _n_ for example doesn't have a number that goes with it."
