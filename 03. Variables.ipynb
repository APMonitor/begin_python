Even if you start a variable name right though, you need to continue it the right way. Anything after the first character you can have __any letter__ (including uppercase), __numbers__, and __underscores__. Try running incorrect variables and then fix them to whatever you want."

    "### Variable Usage\n",
    "Variables can be used in math or when you are trying to show a result, which is very useful but they do have restrictions. Different types of value typically can't be combined, such as ```5 + \"degC\"```. This can sometimes be fixed if you really need __5degC__ to be output. All you do is change the value type of ```5``` manually into a __string__, ```str(5) + \"degC\"```. But, you can't turn a __string__ into a __interger__ which makes sense, the letter _n_ for example doesn't have a number that goes with it."
