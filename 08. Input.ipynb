    "Input simply requests information from the person using the computer. By default the input value is stored as a __string__ so if you're doing a math equation you need to turn it into an __integer__ or __float__. In an egg temperature controller, certain types of eggs may require a different input and you could put that in your code to change the desired temperature. You could also use `input` to manually change power to the heaters.\n",
