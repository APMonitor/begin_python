    "Every programmer must get some background knowledge before using the language more complexly. So if you want to do well in the second, complex part, you should for sure work through the basic information. For the people who already have experience with python and think this doesnâ€™t apply to you, this background knowledge is different because it uses the temperature control lab to help teach and if you don't do it part two won't be so easy.\n",

    "(It is best to follow the lessons in those steps. Some things, such as __equations__, and __tclab functions__, you aren't required to learn but can be useful. If you wish to learn those, __tclab functions__ and __basic python equations__, are on __cheat sheets__ in seperate files. Other general python info, such as equations, can be found online.)\n",
