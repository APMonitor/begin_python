    "\n",
    "These loops often get you stuck in an infinite loop if you aren't careful. You can stop the infinite loop by setting the value of ```True``` to become ```False``` in many ways. In the code below, the infinite loop is broken by making ```x``` one less each time it goes through the loop, with ```x = x - 1```. \n",

    "For numbers, ```for loops``` start counting at 0. So if the loop had a ```range(3)```, it would count 0, 1, 2. For strings, it just prints the individual characters in order so ```\"hi\"``` would just output __h__ then __i__. This can be used in a number of useful ways you may use later in this course. Now using stepping in range, we can print numbers in steps."
