    "These get stuck in an infinite loop if the condition for termination is never met. You can stop the infinite loop by setting the value of ```True``` to become ```False``` in many ways.

For strings, it just prints the individual characters in order so ```\"hi\"``` would just output __h__ then __i__. This can be used in a number of useful ways you may use later in this course. Now using stepping in range, we can print numbers in steps."
