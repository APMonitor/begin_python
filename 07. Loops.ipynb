    "# Loops\n",
    "There are two basic types of loops. Loops for an example would be looping temperature changes for the egg.\n",
    "\n",
    "### While Loops\n",
    "These loops work by repeating until their condition becomes ```False```. These loops often get you stuck in an infinite loop if you aren't careful. You can stop the infinite loop by setting the value of ```True``` to become ```False``` in many ways. In the code below, the infinite loop is broken by making ```x``` one less each time it goes through the loop, with ```x = x - 1```. Try changing the value of ```x```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing used in while loops is the ```==``` symbols. Just one ```=``` means you are assigning a variable, but you can't do that in a ```while``` loop. Instead use the ```==``` to tell the code you are just comparing the two values. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while x == 0:\n",

    "For numbers, it starts at 0 so if the loop had a ```range(3)```, it would count 0, 1, 2. For strings, it just prints the characters in order so ```\"hi\"``` would just be h, i. This can be used in a number of useful ways you may use later in this course. Now using stepping in range, we can print numbers in steps."
