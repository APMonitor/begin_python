    "Objects are created to represent a class that has usable functions. You use a variable format to create an object, assigned to a name, such as ```lab = ```. This is called a parent to child relationship. Naming an object is called this because the child inherents all the functions that the parent had. The child object is what you use in your code. You can name objects the name that you will remember and that are easy to type. For tclab, we prefer to use ```lab```, but it's not required. "
