    "Variables such as `int`, `float`, and `str` types are objects. Objects may also be created from a class template to create a new custom variable. You use a variable assignment to create an object, assigned to a name, such as ```lab = tclab.TCLab()```. This is called a parent (`tclab.TCLab()`) to child (`lab`) relationship because `lab` is created from the class `tclab`. The child object `lab` inherits all the functions of the parent. The child object is modified and customized in your code. You can give objects a name that you will remember and that are easy to type. For `tclab`, we prefer to use ```lab```, but it can be a different name. "
